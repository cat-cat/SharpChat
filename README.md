* Select one of "Release" configurations for running the project
* Select the target for running - simulator or a real device
* Run the project and enjoy!

> For debugging:

* Stop running the app
* Select one of the "Debug" running configurations
* Edit file  [Constants.cs](https://github.com/cat-cat/SharpChat/blob/PreRelease/client/ChatClient/Core/ChatClient.Core.Common/Properties/Constants.cs) - set debugURL the same as baseURL
* Run and enjoy debugging!

### Getting server to work
> Note, you don't need to set up the server if you only interested in client development. For your convinience there's already set up running server at ip address specified in baseURL variable in file [Constants.cs](https://github.com/cat-cat/SharpChat/blob/PreRelease/client/ChatClient/Core/ChatClient.Core.Common/Properties/Constants.cs)

* Clone this repo
* Install on your machine [Node.js 6+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "Node.js download")
* Install and run on your machine [MongoDB 3.2+](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community)
* Install and run on your machine [Redis](https://redis.io/download)
* cd to \<repo root\>/server 
* In system prompt run `npm install -g forever`
* then run `npm install -g yarn`
* then run `npm yarn install`
> For starting Chat Server in release mode:
> * run `yarn build`
> * run `forever start dist/index.js`
> * for finding location of server's log run `forever list`
> * for stopping Chat server run `forever stop 0`


> For starting Chat Server in debug mode:
> * run `yarn watch-dev`
> * see logs of the server in console
> * for stopping server press Ctrl+C

Note: for client to be able to work with you locally running server you should set debugURL variable at [Constants.cs](https://github.com/cat-cat/SharpChat/blob/PreRelease/client/ChatClient/Core/ChatClient.Core.Common/Properties/Constants.cs) to IP address of your server, which can be found at the server's log.
